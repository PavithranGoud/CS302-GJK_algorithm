To compile in terminal:
	g++ -std=c++17 gjk.cpp
To run the compiled output enter this in terminal:
	./a.out


inputs folder contains the inputs given to the program. Any input file is expected to be located
in this folder. Input format goes as : 
	line 1 : number of vertices for polyhedra 1 - N1
	N1 lines follow each containing 3 space seperated numbers denoting each vertex.
	line 2+N1: number of vertices for polyhedra 2 - N2
	N2 lines follow each containing 3 space seperated numbers denoting each vertex.

blender folder contains the .blend files created in blender. We have creted input test cases in
this software. After creating two polyhedra we can import a .obj file which will contain the
vertices of both the polyhedra. We copied this data into .txt files in inputs folder.
Our algorithm gjk.cpp takes these vertices as inputs.
